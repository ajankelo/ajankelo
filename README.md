### Hi there 👋

I am an avid practitioner of the Data-centric AI approach. I conducted several end-to-end DL projects and leveraged the best MLOps practices.

I have developed a growing appreciation for MLOps alongside my new passions in the power of aerial and satellite imagery for Earth Observation.

In the past, I've studied human robotic interaction and the intersection of emotion + philanthropy, which earned me a MS in Applied Sociology.

Projects:
- I conducted end-to-end deep learning pipeline to get impressive results with as few as 50 labeled images.

Skills:
- Strong programming skills.
- Excellent communication skills.
- I am committed to continual learning with a demonstrated track record of adapting my skillset to get the job done.


Tech Stack:
- Languages: Python, Javascript, SQL, Git
- DL frameworks: PyTorch, Fastai, IceVision, Hugging Face
- DS libraries: scikit-learn, scipy, sklearn, statsmodels, seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, numpy
- MLOps: ZenML, Roboflow, FiftyOne.
- Data Labeling: Label Studio, CVAT.
- DL experiment tracking: Weights & Biases
- DL deployment: Hugging Face Spaces, Gradio
- Database: Firebase, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, BigQuery, Neo4J, Weaviate
